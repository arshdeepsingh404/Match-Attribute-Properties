Privacy Policy for MatchAttProp
This Privacy Policy describes the data practices for the MatchAttProp application. To promote transparency and protect user privacy, this policy explicitly addresses the mandatory requirements of the Autodesk App Store.

1. Data Collection and Usage
MatchAttProp does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, user information, or drawing metadata. The application functions by temporarily reading block attribute properties—such as layers, colors, and positions—directly from the active AutoCAD drawing to facilitate the requested synchronization. This data exists only in the computer's volatile memory (RAM) while the command is active and is never saved to external servers or local logs.

2. Third-Party Sharing
This application does not share any information with third parties. There are no integrated analytics tools, advertising SDKs, or external tracking mechanisms included in the software.

3. Data Retention and Deletion
Because the application does not collect or store data, there is no data retention or deletion policy required. All property information processed during a command session is cleared from memory as soon as the application is closed or the command is finalized.

4. User Consent and Data Revocation
As no personal data is collected or stored, there is no information for users to request the deletion of. Users can effectively revoke consent at any time by uninstalling the application using the standard Windows Control Panel or the Autodesk App Store uninstaller.
